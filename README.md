#Part 1: Choosing a Copyright License
For this repository, I have decided to choose the MIT License. 
With the use of this license, It would people give permission, 
without restriction, to use the Software in whatever manner they 
so chose. This would allow many people to build upon the Software 
as well as use the software free of charge in order to help their 
own personal development process. This Licence would all the 
software to be used but allow those who wish to develop their
 own products and give them a choice on what type of license they
 would like to use. When using more liberal licenses such as GPL
 the code can not become proprietary. Doing this could limit the
 want to integrate my system within their product.

#Prupose
This repository contains a product that has the ability to gather
 data from Reddit. This Program can track words that are commonly 
used as well as when new word starts to appear as well as when old 
ones start to dissipate. This data can be used to track trends 
quickly that have been gathered from large sample sizes that have 
also self-categorized themselves allowing for more clear and more 
useful data more many projects.
